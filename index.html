        <h1>Fujisan, sacred place and source of artistic inspiration</h1><br><br> <img src="download.jpeg">
        <p>The beauty of the solitary, often snow-capped, stratovolcano, known around the world as Mount Fuji, rising
            above
            villages and tree-fringed sea and lakes has long been the object of pilgrimages and inspired artists and
            poets.
            The inscribed property consists of 25 sites which reflect the essence of Fujisanâ€™s sacred and artistic
            landscape. In the 12th century, Fujisan became the centre of training for ascetic Buddhism, which included
            Shinto elements. On the upper 1,500-metre tier of the 3,776m mountain, pilgrim routes and crater shrines
            have
            been inscribed alongside sites around the base of the mountain including Sengen-jinja shrines, Oshi lodging
            houses, and natural volcanic features such as lava tree moulds, lakes, springs and waterfalls, which are
            revered
            as sacred. Its representation in Japanese art goes back to the 11th century, but 19th century woodblock
            prints
            of views, including those from sand beaches with pine tree groves have made Fujisan an internationally
            recognized icon of Japan and have had a deep impact on the development of Western art. </p>
